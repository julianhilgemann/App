Considering that planning and documentation happen in parallel I set a hard cap of three months with approximately ten hours a week that I will invest into this project.

After some prompting ChatGPT provided me with this plan that seems suitable for my needs. Project plan and distribution of time ressources below. The TLDR is:


```ChatGPT

Here's a condensed action plan with the timeframes for each step:

1.  **Week 1: Project Preparation (2 hours)**
    
    -   Define objectives, set up project management tools.
2.  **Week 2: Product Backlog Creation (2 hours)**
    
    -   List features, prioritize tasks, and estimate efforts.
3.  **Weeks 3-4: Sprint 1: Ideation, Wireframing, and Design (5 hours)**
    
    -   Finalize design ideas, create wireframes.
4.  **Week 5: Sprint 2: Prototyping (5 hours)**
    
    -   Create a prototype using Google Sheets, iterate on feedback.
5.  **Weeks 6-10: Sprint 3: API Connectivity and Database (40 hours)**
    
    -   Set up Flask, connect data sources, design database schema, develop API endpoints.
6.  **Weeks 11-13: Sprint 4: Interactive Front-end and Deployment (42 hours)**
    
    -   Implement Streamlit front-end, connect to API, test, deploy.

Throughout the project, allocate 5 hours per week to work on documentation (Sprint 5) and presentation (Sprint 6), totaling 65 hours.

This action plan allows you to complete the project within 13 weeks, working 10 hours a week.
```

I won't bother with the specific week allocation and try to stay within the time budget instead, so if I finish Week one up to week three I will just roll with it.

### Project Plan

```ChatGPT

With the additional adjustments you've mentioned, the updated action plan and estimated workload for each step will be as follows:

1. **Project Preparation (2 hours)**
    - Define the project goals and objectives.
    - Set up project management and communication tools (e.g., Trello, Slack).

2. **Product Backlog Creation (2 hours)**
    - List all the features and tasks required for the project.
    - Prioritize the tasks based on importance and dependencies.
    - Estimate the effort required for each task.

3. **Sprint 1: Ideation, Wireframing, and Design (5 hours)**
    - Tools: Figma, Google Sheets
    - Subtasks:
        a. Brainstorm and finalize design ideas (2 hours).
        b. Create wireframes for the application (3 hours).

4. **Sprint 2: Prototyping (5 hours)**
    - Tools: Google Sheets
    - Subtasks:
        a. Create a prototype of the time series forecasting tool using Google Sheets (4 hours).
        b. Iterate on the prototype based on your own feedback (1 hour).

5. **Sprint 3: API Connectivity and Database (40 hours)**
    - Tools: Flask, SQLAlchemy
    - Subtasks:
        a. Set up the Flask API framework (6 hours).
        b. Connect the application to the required data sources (10 hours).
        c. Design and implement the database schema using SQLAlchemy (10 hours).
        d. Develop API endpoints for data retrieval and manipulation (14 hours).

6. **Sprint 4: Interactive Front-end and Deployment (42 hours)**
    - Tools: Streamlit, Github
    - Subtasks:
        a. Implement the interactive front-end using Streamlit (18 hours).
        b. Connect the front-end to the Flask API (6 hours).
        c. Test the application for bugs and performance (6 hours).
        d. Host the project repository on Github (4 hours).
        e. Deploy the application to a suitable hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS) (8 hours).

With these adjustments, you'll spend 54 hours on the main development tasks and have an additional 66 hours to distribute between documentation (Sprint 5) and presentation (Sprint 6), which will happen throughout the whole process. This new plan should allow you to complete the project within three months, working 10 hours a week. Remember that time estimates may vary depending on your familiarity with the tools and technologies involved, and unforeseen challenges may arise. Stay adaptable and periodically review your progress to make necessary adjustments.

### Time Dimension

```ChatGPT

Given that you have approximately 13 weeks (April 27, 2023, to July 31, 2023) to complete the project, you can distribute the six points across each week as follows:

1.  **Week 1: Project Preparation (2 hours)**
    
    -   Define the project goals and objectives.
    -   Set up project management and communication tools (e.g., Trello, Slack).
2.  **Week 2: Product Backlog Creation (2 hours)**
    
    -   List all the features and tasks required for the project.
    -   Prioritize the tasks based on importance and dependencies.
    -   Estimate the effort required for each task.
3.  **Weeks 3-4: Sprint 1: Ideation, Wireframing, and Design (5 hours)**
    
    -   Tools: Figma, Google Sheets
    -   Subtasks: a. Brainstorm and finalize design ideas (2 hours). b. Create wireframes for the application (3 hours).
4.  **Week 5: Sprint 2: Prototyping (5 hours)**
    
    -   Tools: Google Sheets
    -   Subtasks: a. Create a prototype of the time series forecasting tool using Google Sheets (4 hours). b. Iterate on the prototype based on your own feedback (1 hour).
5.  **Weeks 6-10: Sprint 3: API Connectivity and Database (40 hours)**
    
    -   Tools: Flask, SQLAlchemy
    -   Subtasks: a. Set up the Flask API framework (6 hours). b. Connect the application to the required data sources (10 hours). c. Design and implement the database schema using SQLAlchemy (10 hours). d. Develop API endpoints for data retrieval and manipulation (14 hours).
6.  **Weeks 11-13: Sprint 4: Interactive Front-end and Deployment (42 hours)**
    
    -   Tools: Streamlit, Github
    -   Subtasks: a. Implement the interactive front-end using Streamlit (18 hours). b. Connect the front-end to the Flask API (6 hours). c. Test the application for bugs and performance (6 hours). d. Host the project repository on Github (4 hours). e. Deploy the application to a suitable hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS) (8 hours).

Throughout the entire project, allocate time to work on documentation (Sprint 5) and presentation (Sprint 6). You can dedicate around 5 hours per week to these tasks, totaling 65 hours.

This distribution allows you to complete the project within the timeframe of 13 weeks, working 10 hours a week. Remember that time estimates may vary depending on your familiarity with the tools and technologies involved, and unforeseen challenges may arise.

The output looks reasonable, I will roll with it.
