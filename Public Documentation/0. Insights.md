- Possibility to put too much emphasis on planning that is practically unnecessary, especially when MVP is the goal. Refinement and strong design intuition seems to be a matter of production?
- Personal preference for actual coding biases action towards execution and away from planning.
- Hard to realistically estimate timeframes for completion since dependend on skills and actual learning, that might be required "on the job". Not sure yet, if underestimating tasks at hand, if this project is really that easy or overestimating own ability.
