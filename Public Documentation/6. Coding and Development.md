I am quite new to this and just know the basics but I know for sure that I need Github to manage the code and documentation. Thankfully, no issues in setting it up

how can i do it in just terminal. Just code

To create a new Git repository using the folder "App" on your "Desktop" using Terminal in macOS, follow these steps:

1.  Open the Terminal app on your macOS.
    
2.  Navigate to the "Desktop" directory by entering the following command:
    

bash

`cd ~/Desktop`

3.  Create a new folder named "App" on your desktop (if it doesn't already exist) with this command:

arduino

`mkdir App`

4.  Change directory to the newly created "App" folder:

bash

`cd App`

5.  Initialize a new Git repository in the "App" folder:

csharp

`git init`

Now you have a local Git repository in the "App" folder on your Desktop. To add files, make changes, and commit them to your local repository, you can use Terminal commands. For example:

1.  Create a new file, e.g., `README.md`:

bash

`touch README.md`

2.  Add the file to the staging area:

csharp

`git add README.md`

3.  Commit the changes:

sql

`git commit -m "Initial commit"`

To push the changes to a remote repository, first create a new repository on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. Once you've created the remote repository, copy the repository URL. Then, in the Terminal, add the remote repository and push the changes:

1.  Add the remote repository (replace `your-remote-repo-url` with the actual remote repository URL you just copied):

csharp

`git remote add origin your-remote-repo-url`

2.  Push the changes to the remote repository:

perl

`git push -u origin master`

If the default branch is not `master`, replace it with the appropriate branch name (e.g., `main`).

You have now successfully created a new Git repository using the folder "App" on your "Desktop" using Terminal in macOS.
```

Cool. Now I think the first thing I have to do is track the changes and push this liitle update. Trivial steps I guess but important nonetheless.

```ChatGPT
to track changes and upload them to GitHub, follow these steps in the Terminal:

1.  Navigate to your repository folder on your computer:

bash

`cd path/to/your/repo`

Replace `path/to/your/repo` with the actual path to your repository folder.

2.  Check the status of your repository to see the changes you've made:

lua

`git status`

3.  Stage the changes (add the files to the staging area):

For all changed files:

csharp

`git add .`

Or for specific files, replace `your-changed-file` with the actual file name:

csharp

`git add your-changed-file`

4.  Commit the changes with a descriptive message:

sql

`git commit -m "Your commit message"`

Replace `Your commit message` with a brief description of the changes you've made.

5.  Make sure your local repository is up to date with the remote repository:

`git pull origin your-branch-name`

Replace `your-branch-name` with the name of the branch you're working on (e.g., `main` or `master`).

6.  Push the changes to the remote GitHub repository:

perl

`git push origin your-branch-name`

Replace `your-branch-name` with the name of the branch you're working on (e.g., `main` or `master`).

Your changes are now uploaded to GitHub.
```

Or this. Done :) 

```ChatGPT
```bash
cd path/to/your/repo
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git pull origin your-branch-name
git push origin your-branch-name
```
```
