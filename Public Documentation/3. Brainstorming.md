Now that the boring part is done this is where the fun begins. Time for divergent thinking and ideation on what this will look like, considering technical and time budget limits.

Obviously I will save some calories by getting the rough sketch from ChatGPT by asking to suggest relevant objectives and whether Asana will be fine:

```ChatGPT

in Week 1, your primary focus should be on project preparation, which involves defining the relevant objectives and setting up project management tools.

Relevant objectives for your time series forecasting tool project may include:

1.  Developing an interactive and user-friendly web application for time series forecasting.
2.  Supporting data input from various sources such as CSV files or APIs.
3.  Implementing popular forecasting methods and models like ARIMA, SARIMA, and Prophet.
4.  Visualizing forecasting results through interactive charts and graphs.
5.  Enabling users to fine-tune forecasting models by adjusting parameters.
6.  Ensuring the application is scalable, reliable, and easy to maintain.

Asana is a versatile and popular project management tool that can help you manage your project effectively. It allows you to create tasks, assign them to team members (if applicable), set deadlines, and track progress. You can use Asana to break down the project into smaller tasks, organize them in different sections or columns (corresponding to each sprint), and keep track of your progress as you move through the project.

Asana should do the job for managing your project. However, if you prefer a more lightweight tool, Trello is another excellent option for organizing tasks and managing your project using a Kanban-style board. Both Asana and Trello offer free plans that should be sufficient for managing a project of this size.

In summary, start by defining the relevant objectives for your project, and then choose a project management tool like Asana (or Trello) to help you organize tasks, track progress, and ensure a smooth workflow throughout the project.

Good, but a bit too high in terms of needs. No need to scale. So I will prompt ahead and see what objectives seem fine. I'd say it's not 100% perfect but shall be enough for me to work with

```ChatGPT
Based on your description, here are ten objectives for your time series forecasting tool project:

1. Develop a simple and user-friendly analytics app and data dashboard with a clean, foolproof interface.
2. Enable users to choose from a predefined set of variables to visualize time series data.
3. Integrate the European Central Bank API and/or Bundesbank API to fetch relevant data for the chosen variables.
4. Allow users to select the time frequency of the data (yearly, quarterly, or monthly) to be plotted.
5. Display time series data in a line chart, with options for additional exploratory charts such as bar charts, seasonal plots, and density plots.
6. Show rates of change and correlation charts (ACF and PACF) for the chosen time series data.
7. Provide a selection of forecasting models for the user to choose from (e.g., ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet).
8. Update the interface to show relevant input fields or options based on the chosen forecasting model.
9. Implement a "RUN MODEL" button that, when clicked, estimates the chosen model on the data and refreshes the visualization accordingly.
10. Ensure the application is responsive, scalable, and easy to maintain for future updates and improvements.

These ten objectives encompass the core features and functionality you want to provide in your time series forecasting tool, based on your description. By focusing on these objectives, you can develop a project plan and set priorities for each stage of the development process.

Tikz code by ChatGPT when it comes to the Flowchart of the MVP. I am impressed

```Latex
\documentclass{standalone}
\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{shapes.geometric, arrows, positioning}

\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}[
  userBlock/.style={rectangle, draw, text width=3.5cm, text centered, rounded corners, fill=yellow},

  arrow/.style={thick, ->, >=stealth}
]

% User perspective nodes
\node[userBlock] (userVisit) {User visits website};
\node[userBlock, below=1cm of userVisit] (userSelect) {User selects time series};
\node[userBlock, below=1cm of userSelect] (userRun) {User clicks "RUN MODEL"};

% Streamlit perspective nodes

\node[streamlitBlock, below=1cm of streamlitRequest] (streamlitReceive) {Streamlit receives data and model metrics};

\node[flaskBlock, below=1cm of flaskProcess] (flaskSend) {Flask sends data and metrics to Streamlit};

% Arrows
\draw[arrow] (userVisit) -- (userSelect);
